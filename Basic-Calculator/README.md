# HMMM Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator program implemented in HMMM (Harvard Modified Machine Language). The calculator takes two input values and performs basic arithmetic operations on them, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Motivation

I created this project to deepen my understanding of HMMM and assembly language programming. It allowed me to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during my HMMM course to build a practical calculator that can perform fundamental arithmetic operations.

## How to Use

To use the HMMM Simple Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Input the first number.
2. Input the second number.
3. The program will perform four operations consecutively:
   - First, it will add the two numbers.
   - Second, it will subtract the second number from the first.
   - Third, it will multiply the two numbers.
   - Fourth, it will divide the first number by the second.

The program will display the results of each operation.

## Getting Started

To run this HMMM program:

1. Open the link: https://shickey.github.io/HMMM.js/#/
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Load the HMMM code file from the repository.
4. Provide the input values as prompted.
