# HMMM Calculator

This is a simple calculator program implemented in HMMM (Harvard Modified Machine Language). The calculator is designed to take three inputs, where the third input specifies the type of operation to be performed. The operation codes are as follows:
- 0: Addition
- 1: Subtraction
- 2: Multiplication
- 3: Division

## Motivation

I created this project as a way to further my understanding of HMMM and assembly language programming. It provided an excellent opportunity to reinforce the concepts I learned in my HMMM course and to apply them in a practical context. By developing a calculator, I was able to grasp how to work with input, perform basic arithmetic operations, and handle conditional execution in HMMM.

## How to Use

To use this calculator, follow these steps:

1. Input the first number.
2. Input the second number.
3. Input the operation code (0 for addition, 1 for subtraction, 2 for multiplication, 3 for division).
4. The program will then execute the selected operation and display the result.

Feel free to explore the HMMM code in this repository to understand how the calculator is implemented.

## Running the Program

You can run this HMMM program using a compatible HMMM simulator or interpreter. Make sure to provide the necessary input values as specified above.

## Contribution

This project was created as a personal learning exercise. If you have suggestions for improvements or spot any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always eager to learn and improve, so any feedback or contributions are greatly appreciated.
