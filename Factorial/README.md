# HMMM Factorial Calculator

This is a simple HMMM (Harvard Modified Machine Language) program that calculates the factorial of a given input number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers from 1 to that number.

## Motivation

I created this program to illustrate how HMMM can be used to perform mathematical calculations, especially factorial calculations. It serves as an educational example for those learning HMMM and assembly language programming.

## Usage

To use the HMMM Factorial Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Input a positive integer for which you want to calculate the factorial.
2. The program will compute the factorial of the input number and display the result.

## Getting Started

To run this HMMM program, you need access to an HMMM emulator or simulator. Here are the steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open an HMMM emulator or simulator. (You can use this website: https://shickey.github.io/HMMM.js/#/)
3. Load the HMMM code file (`factorial.hmmm`) from the repository.
4. Input the number for which you want to calculate the factorial.

Happy calculating!
