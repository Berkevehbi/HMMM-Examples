# HMMM Examples

This repository contains a collection of HMMM (Harvard Modified Machine Language) code examples that I have created while learning and experimenting with HMMM. These examples cover various aspects of HMMM, ranging from basic instructions to more complex programming concepts.

## Motivation

I created this repository to share my progress in learning HMMM and to provide a resource for others interested in HMMM programming. Each example comes with a brief description and a link to the HMMM code file, making it easy to explore and understand the concepts.

## Getting Started

To explore the HMMM examples in this repository, simply click on the links in the table of contents. You can also clone this repository to your local machine to run the HMMM code using a compatible HMMM emulator or simulator.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have additional HMMM examples, improvements to existing examples, or any other enhancements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's make this repository a valuable resource for the HMMM community.
